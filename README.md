# Blackjack

Personalized Blackjack game in Java GUI using JFrame, JPanel, and JButton.

Used a multi-class system that allowed to personalize the game and make it as accurate as I can by implement behaviors and rules that the player and dealer are required to follow.

Examples:
-  Soft-17 rule for the dealer: making it so the dealer has to say when he reaches a value of 17 even if he has an Ace in hand.
-  "Hit" and "Stay" buttons for UI so that the player can interact with the application.

Added image insertion so the application updates when the Player decided to "Hit" or get another card. This was done by accessing files and adding an ImageIcon into the panel.
